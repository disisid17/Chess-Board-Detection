# Chess-Board-Detection

**Detecting and processing chess boards using OpenCV**

---

## Description

This project uses computer vision (OpenCV in Python) to detect a chessboard in images or live video. It identifies the grid, extracts corners, and can be extended for applications like digitizing chess positions or tracking moves.

---

## Features

- Detects chessboard patterns in images/video  
- Finds corners and squares using OpenCV functions  
- Provides a basis for automating chessboard recognition
